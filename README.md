# Surf & Paddle
This was our week 1 day 4 assignment.
Our goal was to create a pixel-perfect website from a picture.

The project was entirely `HTML` + `CSS`.  We worked with flexbox to align items, as well as various styling methods in order to get things perfect.

I was able to further hone my positioning and sizing skills through this project, as well as learn how to quickly get hex colors out of an image.
